# qdb-3.0  [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/rit-sse/qdb-3.0/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/rit-sse/qdb-3.0/tree/master)
The [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) Version of the QDB

## Development Setup

#### Prerequisites:
You must have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

The QDB also uses the SSE [node-api](https://github.com/rit-sse/node-api), so you'll need to have a development version running. Follow its [instructions](https://github.com/rit-sse/node-api/blob/master/README.md) for getting setup and familiarize yourself with its [docs](http://docs.sse.apiary.io/) before you start working with the QDB.

#### Installation:

1. Clone the repo
2. `cd` into that directory
3. Run `npm install` to get the necessary dependencies
4. Run `gulp` to build the site & start the server
5. You can view the site at `127.0.0.1:3000/qdb/`
